# LoggerCounter

The project has tests written in RSpec. In order to run them type `rspec`. I have also added simplecov to see code's test coverage.

I used Rubocop and git hooks to be sure that before committing and pushing, the code has no lint issues. 
At first, I wanted to run RSpec before pushing, but it doesn't have sense unless I tried to follow TDD.

To run main program type `ruby run.rb`
